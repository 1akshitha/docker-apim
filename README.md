# WSO2 API Manager Docker Resources

This repository contains following Docker resources:

- WSO2 API Manager Dockerfile
- WSO2 API Manager Docker Compose Templates

The WSO2 API Manager Dockerfile builds a generic Docker image for deploying API Manager in containerized environments. It includes the JDK, product distribution and a collection of utility libraries. Configurations, JDBC driver, extensions and other deployable artifacts are designed to be provided via volume mounts.

The Docker Compose templates have been created according to standard API Manager deployment patterns for allowing users to evaluate the product and understand the deployment architecture in depth.
